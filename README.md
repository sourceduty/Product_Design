Sourceduty works on the development and distribution of high-quality [3D models](https://cults3d.com/en/users/sourceduty/3d-models). By leveraging both proprietary and open-source assets, the company fosters collaboration within the creative and tech communities. Sourceduty has a significant opportunity to sell its existing 3D model and GPT assets in the rapidly expanding world of virtual environments, where demand for immersive digital spaces is accelerating. With industries such as gaming, virtual reality (VR), and the metaverse continuing to grow, Sourceduty’s expertise in creating detailed, customizable 3D models can be utilized to develop highly engaging and visually stunning environments. By offering virtual assets tailored for games, virtual social spaces, and even educational or training simulations, Sourceduty can tap into a market that is projected to evolve and expand dramatically in the coming years.

3D modeling can often become a frustrating and time-consuming process, especially when projects expand unexpectedly due to the inevitable cycle of mistakes, revisions, and constant client or team edits. What initially begins as a straightforward task can quickly evolve into a prolonged endeavor, as each small adjustment or oversight in the model often ripples into more complex fixes and re-rendering. This unpredictable workflow not only delays completion timelines but also adds to the operational burden, making it difficult to maintain efficiency or meet deadlines. For someone like Alex, who still actively creates 3D models and engages in 3D printing, the process becomes even more resource-intensive—not just in terms of time but also energy and material costs. Despite the creative fulfillment it offers, the work rarely translates into strong profitability, as the hours poured into perfecting each model often outweigh the financial return. This imbalance between effort and income, compounded by the iterative nature of the work, makes 3D modeling and printing a labor of passion rather than a lucrative pursuit.
